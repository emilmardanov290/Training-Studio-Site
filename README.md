# Training-Studio-Site
This project is based on an open-source HTML/CSS template, customized for a fitness theme. I adapted the layout, colors, and fonts, and added sections for workout schedules, class descriptions, and motivational content. The process helped me practice HTML, CSS, and responsive design.
